# New Note

Hi :wave: this Note is generated by [Markdown HTML](https://replit.com/@ErikoXDev/Markdown-HTML?v=1)!
It uses Githubs Markdown style and auto refreshes in your browser while you edit files!


## Getting Started

This page can be changed by editing the `index.md` file.
Create more pages by making more markdown files ([Example](apple))

Press the sun/moon in the bottom right corner to toggle between dark and light mode!

I recommend using this guide for Markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

## Examples

Create a todo list:

- [x] Get bread, butter and ham
- [ ] Make a sandwich

Write some code:

```javascript
// Javascript is awesome
console.log("Hello World!")
```

The possibilities are only limited by your imagination :wink:.
